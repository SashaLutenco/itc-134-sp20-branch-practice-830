In this story, a heroic mobster falls passionately in love with an amiable wanderer - all thanks to a flashback.
This story starts in a grocery store in a manufacturing city.

His flashback happened after he got into the hospital. He was hurt while hunting the most wanted person in manufacturing city.
The city is a rough place, even for mobsters. The streets are filled with giant rats and were smoked with fumes from the manufacturing company. With campers everywhere; nowhere to run. The streets of Tacoma will never be the same. 

The mobsters name was Vincent De Luca, everyone knew him as Vinnie. Vinnie was in hot pursuit of the most wanted person in the city, Bob. Just thinking about that name had shooken up Vinnie, he knew the horrible acts of violence and terror Bob had rained upon Tacoma, he knew he had to stop him at all costs.

Unfortounately for Vinnie, Bob was a merciless tyrant who coughed on Gym equipment and did curls on the bench press. Bob was a king amongst the low of the low. Vinnie had to tread lightly or his story would be told in a college course as a throw away practice assignment.

If he fails he will be banished to Downtown Tacoma where the zombies roam.

Vinnie did't understand that all he had to do is go back to the grocery store and find his love to become happy. He didn't need this life. The mobset style wasn't for fim after all.

Although Vinnie thought this, he knew he had to take care of Bob first. The reason being that Bob had held all of the women of Tacoma captive in his nightclub, keeping them trapped there for forever. Vinnie had needed to devise a plan to eliminate or capture Bob, he had an idea to use the zombies from Downtown Tacoma to overrun the nightclub.

Vinnie used the Uno reverse card and the Blue Eyes White Dragon to defeat Bob...but Bob is Bob, and Bob never dies. He lives inside YOU!
Long live ASAP BOB!
