In this story, a heroic mobster falls passionately in love with an amiable wanderer - all thanks to a flashback.
This story starts in a grocery store in a manufacturing city.

His flashback happened after he got into the hospital. He was hurt while hunting the most wanted person in manufacturing city.
The city is a rough place, even for mobsters. The streets are filled with giant rats and were smoked with fumes from the manufacturing company. With campers everywhere; nowhere to run. The streets of Tacoma will never be the same. 

The mobsters name was Vincent De Luca, everyone knew him as Vinnie. Vinnie was in hot pursuit of the most wanted person in the city, Bob. Just thinking about that name had shooken up Vinnie, he knew the horrible acts of violence and terror Bob had rained upon Tacoma, he knew he had to stop him at all costs.
